# Roadmap

These are some things I'm interested in exploring. Inclusion in this list doesn't mean it will be added to Hexasperate, just that I think it's worth considering.

## Controls
- [x] Touch events for mobile browsers
- [x] Drag contiguous tiles that aren't in the grid
- [ ] On hover, show an outline around all the tiles you could drag with right click
- [ ] Multi-drag touch controls
- [ ] Lock a tile in place

## Puzzles
- [x] Complex puzzle shapes
- [ ] Custom puzzle shape designer

## Options
- [ ] Custom palettes and backgrounds
- [ ] Patterned backgrounds for tiles in addition to just color swaps
- [ ] Show option alternatives in the options menu

## Accessibility
- [ ] Alternate controls (keyboard, controller?)
- [ ] Control remapping
- [ ] Get more ideas from http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Overhaul zoom/scaling and use a single coordinate system

## Non-Code
- [x] How to run from source in Readme
- [x] Separate dev/prod builds
- [ ] Favicon
