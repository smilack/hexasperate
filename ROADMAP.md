# Roadmap

These are some things I'm interested in exploring. Inclusion in this list doesn't mean it will be added to Hexasperate, just that I think it's worth considering.

- [ ] Custom palettes and backgrounds
- [ ] Alternate controls (keyboard, controller?)
- [ ] Control remapping
- [ ] Lock a tile in place
- [ ] Drag contiguous tiles that aren't in the grid
- [ ] On hover, show an outline around all the tiles you could drag with right click
- [ ] Show option alternatives in the options menu
- [ ] Patterned backgrounds for tiles in addition to just color swaps
- [ ] How to run from source in Readme
- [ ] Separate dev/prod builds
- [ ] Touch events for mobile browsers
