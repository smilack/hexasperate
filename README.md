## How to Play

The goal of Hexasperate is to place all the hexagonal tiles in the grid so that everywhere two hexagons touch, the colors match.

Tiles can be dragged with the mouse:
* Left clicking and dragging any hexagon moves that one hexagon.
* Right clicking a hexagon in the grid and dragging it will move it and all tiles connected to it.
